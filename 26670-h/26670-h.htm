<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>In a book of this kind there is no particular
need for dwelling at length on the
desirability of having a fireplace. That
will be taken for granted. It is enough
to say that in these days a home can
scarcely be considered worthy of the name
if it does not contain at least one hearth.
There is some inexplicable quality in a
wood fire that exerts almost a hypnotic
influence upon those who eagerly gather
about it. The smoldering glow of the
logs induces a calm and introspective
mood that banishes all the trivialities and
distractions of the day&#8217;s work and gives
one an opportunity to replenish his store
of energy for the coming day.</p>

<p>The open fire, unlike most of the comforts
that we demand in a modern home,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>has been associated with the race as far
back almost as the home itself. At first,
of course, it was as a necessity and the
development from that to a luxury has
been an exceedingly slow one extending
over the years down to the present time.</p>

<p>There are two forms of the open fire&mdash;a
possible third one, the gas log, being a
subject on which the less said the better.
We have, therefore, a choice between the
open fireplace designed for wood and the
basket grate in which to burn coal, preferably
cannel coal. This latter fuel is not
nearly so well known in this country as
in England where the scarcity of wood
necessarily makes coal the more commonly
used fuel. With our own abundance
of wood, however, there will perhaps
be little hesitancy in choosing the
open fireplace rather than the basket
grate for coal, although in certain cases,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>for example an apartment where the flue
has been built too small, or in a house
where an available chimney offers only a
small flue area for fireplace use, the basket
grate will prove a welcome solution of
the problem. Of course there is no excuse
whatever for building a modern home
with a chimney too small for the sort of
fireplace you want, but where the chimney
has already been built without this provision
it may possibly be found that a
small terra cotta flue lining may be inserted
in the larger flue without seriously
damaging the latter&#8217;s power of draft. In
that event the addition of a basket grate
fireplace to an old house would be an interesting
possibility.</p>

<p>However fully we may appreciate the
desirability of some sort of fireplace,
there seems to be a rather widespread impression
that the attainment is largely a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>matter of chance. Too many home-builders
have instructed their architects
to provide a fireplace or two in the fond
hope that the matter was then practically
closed&mdash;a mere matter of time until they
might be sitting before the fire&#8217;s cheerful
glow. Too frequently the result has been
a disappointment when the first few trials
introduced into the room more smoke than
heat or cheer. The reason for this is
that there is a scientific basis for fireplace
building which is frequently ignored
absolutely by an over-confident and stupid
mason. Where the work of building the
home has been entrusted to an architect&#8217;s
hands the latter usually appreciates the
fact that the building of the fireplaces is
liable more than any other part of the
house to be taken into the mason&#8217;s own
hands with, if he is not watched, disastrous
results. Undoubtedly every mason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>would resent most strongly any insinuation
as to his lack of knowledge regarding
fireplace construction. Each mason not
only thinks that he knows how a fireplace
should be built, but it is almost as general
a rule that he feels that his particular
method is the only correct one.</p>

</div>


<p>In view of this it might be well for any
man building his own home to give some
attention to the matter of his fireplaces,
to insist on knowing how they are designed
and to follow their construction
throughout so that there is no chance for
a blunder; and this chance is not so slight
as might be supposed. In a house in
which the author had carefully shown
every detail of construction in the drawings,
it was found when the building was
nearly completed that the cast-iron throat
flues, which ordinarily prevent any possible
mistake of construction on the mason&#8217;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>part, had been put in reversed and
it was necessary to tear down the whole
face of the chimney breast in each case to
replace them properly.</p>

<p>The matter of construction is not at all
a complicated affair, as the next chapter
will aim to show.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CONSTRUCTION" id="CONSTRUCTION"></a>CONSTRUCTION</h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> chief difficulty in attaining a successful
fireplace design does not lie
in securing an abundant draft. In fact
it is an easy matter to make a fireplace
draw if the flue is large enough and the
opening from the fire chamber into the
flue unobstructed. There will never be
any question of getting a roaring blaze
the moment the fire is lighted.</p>

<p>This is, in a way, the type of fireplace
that our Colonial ancestors built&mdash;great
cavernous openings and generous flues,
with the result that the more wood was
piled upon the blaze the more they blistered
their toes and at the same time
chilled their backs. For it is evident that
when we secure such a strong, unobstructed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>current of hot air up the chimney,
enough cool air to take its place must
be drawn into the room through every
opening and crevice. The result is a
mighty draft that rushes past those unfortunate
enough to be sitting about the
fire and carries rapidly up the chimney
almost all of the heat of combustion.</p>

<p>In the fireplace of our Colonial ancestors
probably ninety per cent. of the
heat was entirely lost, being carried up
the chimney. However, cord wood was
then to be had for the cutting.</p>

<p>We want a different sort of a fire in
these days&mdash;one that will burn with a
steady, constant blaze or glow, conserving
most of its heat, which the back and sides
of the fire chamber will reflect out into
the room.</p>

<p>Such a fireplace will not necessarily be
a large one. It is amusing to hear how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>universally the demand goes up for large
fireplaces&mdash;&#8220;great big fellows that will
burn full cord wood.&#8221; It is hard to see
just why this is. It may be based on
the assumption that if a small fireplace is
desirable a large one is more so. This
is a fallacy that the architect and fireplace
builder find it hard to dispel.
There is no objection whatever to a large
fireplace in a summer camp or informal
shack of that sort. In fact a small one
would in such a place be ridiculous, but
when we come to our year-round living-room
or dining-room or den, where the
walls of the room are tight and the whole
atmosphere quieter and more restrained,
a large fireplace would be distinctly a
disturbing element. Such a room as this,
unless very poorly built, would not permit
the in-take of sufficient air for the
draft of a big fireplace, whereas in our
slab cabin or log bungalow the conditions
are quite different.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 216px;">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
<a href="images/illu_10.jpg">
<img class="dblborder" src="images/illu_10_th.jpg" width="216" height="389" alt="A section through the fireplace and
chimney" title="A section through the fireplace and chimney" /></a>
<span class="caption">A section through the fireplace and
chimney. The broad cross-hatching represents
brickwork</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>For the ordinary room, therefore, a
fair average size for the fireplace opening
is three feet in width by two and a half
feet high, with a depth half the width.
From such a fireplace it is possible to get a
maximum of heat with a minimum of draft.</p>

<p>There are two vital principles that
should be observed in the design of any
fireplace. One of these is the relation between
the size of the opening into the
room and the size of the flue itself. A
cross-section of the flue&mdash;which incidentally
should be kept the same throughout
its extent&mdash;should be one-tenth of
the area of the opening into the room.
The second vital consideration is the introduction
of what are known as a
&#8220;smoke shelf&#8221; and a &#8220;smoke chamber.&#8221;
The reason for constructing a fireplace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>with these two features will appear more
readily by reference to the diagram.
This is drawn to show that when a fire is
kindled on the hearth the warm air current,
which is generated immediately, begins
to rise through the throat (the opening
between the fire chamber and the
smoke chamber) and at once induces a
down-draft of cold air. If the back of
the fireplace were on the same continuous
plane with the rear side of the chimney
flue, this downward current of cold air
would strike directly upon the fire itself
and force smoke out into the room. The
smoke shelf is built just where it will prevent
this action. The sectional diagram
does not perhaps make quite clear the
shape of this smoke chamber, but the accompanying
perspective outline sketch
will indicate the fact that the throat and
the smoke chamber at the bottom must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>extend across the full width of the fire
chamber. This width in the smoke
chamber immediately diminishes in rising
until it joins the flue at the flue&#8217;s own
area.</p>

<p>The sectional diagram indicates a cast-iron
damper built in the throat. This is
not necessary, for it contributes nothing
to the efficiency of the fire itself. Its one
great advantage is that by furnishing the
mason with an unalterable form, it forces
him to build the throat properly rather
than in one of the wrong ways that his
own judgment might dictate. Such a
cast-iron damper also forms a support
for the flat arch of brick over the opening
if bricks are used. If the damper is
not built in, it is necessary to use an iron
supporting bar to carry this flat arch.
Then too, in case the damper is not used,
there is lost the advantage of being able
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>quite readily to close the throat entirely,
which is highly desirable in the summertime
and frequently in the winter when
the fireplace is acting too strenuously as
a ventilator. If the cast-iron throat is
not used, therefore, it will be well to lay
an iron plate on the smoke shelf in such
a way that it could be drawn forward
across the opening to close it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 252px;">

<img class="dblborder" src="images/illu_14_th.jpg" width="252" height="408" alt="Perspective view" title="Perspective view" /></a>
<span class="caption">Perspective view of the fireplace, showing the
shape of the various parts as built without a
cast-iron throat damper</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>There are other types of dampers, most
of them patented and all of them aiming
to provide an adjustable opening in the
throat in some way. One or two of these
have a knob or handle projecting through
the brickwork of the arch, permitting the
convenient adjustment of the damper
from outside. As a general principle,
however, it is well to choose the simplest
possible device that will secure the desired
result.</p>

<p>The terra cotta flue lining which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>shown in the sectional diagram is not absolutely
necessary, of course, as it is
a rather modern introduction and unnumbered
fireplaces have served their purpose
without it. There is no question, however,
regarding its worth, for it provides a flue
with smooth, regular sides that will not
clog nearly so readily as an ordinary
brick flue. Besides that, it has the advantage
of permitting a thinner wall for
the chimney. It is dangerous to build
a chimney with a single four-inch thickness
of brick between the flue and whatever
may adjoin the chimney. Of course
no wood should be allowed to come within
an inch or two of the brickwork in
any event, but with a single thickness
of brick, unlined, there is always
the danger that the mortar will crumble
from a joint and leave an opening
through which it would be an easy matter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>for sparks or flame to do considerable
damage. The introduction of a flue lining,
however, into the chimney built in this
way makes it entirely safe, provided the
joints between sections of flue lining are
carefully filled and made smooth with cement
mortar.</p>

<p>The sectional diagram, it will be noticed,
indicates a difference between the main
back wall of the chimney, eight inches
thick, and the brickwork laid inside the
fire chamber to form the hearth and the
back. The reason for this separation is
that the rough brickwork of the chimney
is always laid first as simply as possible,
leaving the fire chamber with its sloping
back and sides and the hearth to be filled
in later with a better grade of brick or
perhaps another kind. Frequently, also,
tile will be combined with the brick finish
as a hearth or facing.</p>

large stone fireplace with slightly arched opening</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>A support for the hearth is usually obtained
as indicated&mdash;by bringing what
is called a &#8220;row-lock&#8221; or &#8220;trimmer&#8221;
arch between the foundation masonry of
the chimney and a pair of floor joists set
out at the proper distance, depending
upon the desired width of the hearth.
While this is the customary method, occasionally
a support is secured in some
other way, such as corbeling out from the
masonry foundation, or by extending two
short projections of this masonry from
the bottom up at either end of the hearth
and throwing an arch across between
these. Upon a bed of cement the hearth
bricks themselves are laid, usually flush
with the floor, although occasionally
enough higher to permit a beveled molding
strip to cover the joint between brick and
floor more closely. In some cases the
hearth itself is raised the full thickness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>of a brick above the floor, as in one of
the photographic illustrations shown.</p>

<p>The width of the hearth is ordinarily
made about sixteen or eighteen inches beyond
the face of the opening with the average
size fireplace, twenty inches or even
more with larger ones. This width should
be increased, of course, if the opening is
made considerably larger. The question
of materials for the hearth and facing
will be discussed in the next chapter.</p>

<p>The chimney itself should extend at
least a foot or two above any nearby roof
ridge and it should work without any
cowl, whirligig or other device of that
type on the top. There is no great objection
to having the opening a horizontal
one at the top of the chimney, although
in that case if the flue is nearly straight
throughout its course, some rain will find
its way down to the hearth in a hard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>storm. In most cases there is enough
bend in the flue to prevent this, and if not
it may be avoided by covering the top of
the chimney with a stone and having the
openings vertical ones on all four sides
just under this.</p>

<p>All of the brickwork throughout chimney
and fireplace should be laid in first-class
cement mortar which consists of one
part Portland cement to three parts clean,
sharp sand. Although lime mortar was
used in all brickwork up to recent years,
it is not durable, particularly in the vicinity
of heat.</p>

<h2><a name="MISCELLANEOUS_ODD_FORMS" id="MISCELLANEOUS_ODD_FORMS"></a>MISCELLANEOUS ODD FORMS</h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here</span> are many unusual forms of
fireplace with which we are not particularly
concerned. For example, one
sees occasionally an opening shaped like
an inverted heart or like an ace of spades.
It is possible to make a fireplace of this
kind work satisfactorily, but it is by no
means certain that this result can be accomplished
at the first trial nor that the
fire will continue to work properly under
all conditions. It is safer always to adhere
to the established type of rectangular
opening, or to depart from this only to
the extent of having the top an arch of
large radius. Whenever the top is permitted
to vary more than a slight extent
from the horizontal there is the danger of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>having the smoke escape into the room at
the top.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 335px;">
<a name="An_Inglenook_with_Stone_Hearth" id="An_Inglenook_with_Stone_Hearth"></a>

<span class="caption">The inglenook seldom fails as a dispenser of home cheer.
Frequently the seats are placed too close to the fire</span>
</div>

<p>There is one other type that deserves
special mention and that is the double fireplace,
where two openings in adjacent
rooms are served by a single flue between
them. The only way in which this affects
the two vital principles mentioned above
is that the cross-section area of the flue
should be one-tenth of the combined areas
of the openings. The throat will in this
case be in the middle of the chimney with
the smoke shelf on either side of it. It is
essential in a fireplace of this kind that
there be no disturbing draft tending to
pass through the opening from one room
to the other.</p>

<p>Still another type which is even more
rarely seen is the open fire in the middle
of a room, such as may be desired occasionally
in the lounging room of a large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>club. Such an apparent anomaly could
be secured by suspending a metal flue and
hood from the roof, so that the lower edge
of the truncated pyramidal form at the
bottom would form the upper side of the
fireplace &#8220;opening&#8221; at a convenient
height above the hearth of brick, stone,
tile or concrete. It is conceivable that
an effective and thoroughly practical fireplace
could be thus devised, having the
flue and hood of wrought iron or copper,
suspended and steadied by chains or bars
from the ceiling and surrounding walls.
In such a form the same principle of a
fixed ratio between opening (here the entire
perimeter of the hood multiplied by
the distance above the hearth) and cross-section
of flue would have to be observed,
and here also it would be well to provide
as fully as possible against the presence
of disturbing drafts.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="FACINGS_AND_MANTELS" id="FACINGS_AND_MANTELS"></a>FACINGS AND MANTELS</h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here</span> is not a particularly wide
choice of materials available for the
finish of the hearth and fireplace. Stone,
brick, cement and tile exhaust the possibilities,
although with combinations of
these we have all the variety that we could
wish.</p>

<p>Stone is suitable only in certain environments&mdash;the
informal shack or log
cabin chiefly, though of course it is impossible
to make any hard and fast rule
in the matter.</p>

<p>Brick is almost never out of place.
Perhaps it is the association with the fireplaces
that have been built by our fathers
and grandfathers, or perhaps it is the inherent
worth and fitness of the material
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>itself that puts it forward as a first
choice. Undoubtedly the practical consideration
that it is easier and more economical
to build has something to do with
the matter.</p>

<p>Concrete is a newcomer in the field of
fireplace facing and as yet it cannot be
said to have shown any particular reason
why it should displace the other materials.
With the ordinary heat developed in
an open fire of wood there is no likelihood
of cracking the concrete facing if the material
has been properly mixed and applied,
although there seems to be a vague
impression that this might be a real danger.
The color of concrete gives it no
particular recommendation, for it is one
that remains unchanged by fire, though
not unstained by smoke. Brick, on the
other hand, and tile, have the very closest
possible association with fire in the making,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>which gives them a peculiar fitness
for this purpose.</p>

<span class="caption">Caen stone or its clever representation in cement

</div>

<p>Tile, the last of the four materials,
gives more latitude in design than any of
the others, sometimes too much latitude
we feel. If understandingly used, nothing
could be more appropriate and attractive,
but tile has been used so carelessly
that somehow we have a feeling that the
tiled fireplace is for show rather than for
use. In any case, there is no question
whatever regarding the unfitness of the
glazed tiles which have made horrors of
thousands of pseudo fireplace openings.
It is only the mat-glazed or unglazed tiles
that have any right to be used in such a
place.</p>

<p>Since this little volume has for its subject
the fireplace rather than the mantel,
little need be said regarding the latter
outward form, though there is no doubt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>that a whole book on the subject might
profitably be written. To touch upon
the subject as lightly as space will permit,
we can probably do no better than to
suggest the obvious type of mantel for
one or two of the more common architectural
styles, and recommend that in other
styles the architect be allowed sufficient
latitude in design and expense to distinguish
this important feature of hall, living-room,
dining-room or library with the
characteristics of the style he has worked
out for the house itself.</p>

<p>The modern home along Colonial lines
is perhaps the commonest problem, and
incidentally the easiest, for the old models
of delicately detailed white-painted wood
mantels are so well known and so universally
admired that modern reproductions
along good lines and reasonable cost are
easily obtained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>For the English plaster or half-timber
house the architect will doubtless design
a special mantel, in scale and in harmony
with the dark paneling and other architectural
woodwork, probably with a paneled
over-mantel if the cost is not too rigorously
held down.</p>

<p>In a house which breaks away from the
historic architectural styles, as so many
of the stucco buildings of the day do, the
mantel treatment offers particularly interesting
possibilities. Frequently the mantel
is done away with entirely and the
chimney breast treated independently as
a whole.</p>

<p>With the very informal type of summer
home where a rough stone for facing
and chimney is employed, the mantel treatment
can hardly be kept too simple and
unobtrusive in its rugged strength. A
heavy log, planed to a smooth top surface
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>and resting on two projecting stone
brackets, is frequently used with good
effect. The chimney breast may be
stepped back at the shelf height to form
a narrow stone ledge, or the breast left
without any shelf. Many simple variations
with the informal brick chimney
breast will occur to everyone. In general,
with these summer shacks or bungalows,
the fireplace is the chief architectural
feature of the living-room and for
that reason will stand a moderate amount
of embellishment, but this latter should
take the form of a slightly better finish
of the materials used throughout the room
rather than the introduction of more elaborate
and costly ones.</p>

<h2><a name="MENDING_POOR_FIREPLACES" id="MENDING_POOR_FIREPLACES"></a>MENDING POOR FIREPLACES</h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> is well enough to say just how a fireplace
should be built so that it will
work satisfactorily, but that does not go
far in helping the man who has a fireplace
that will not work. Frequently it is possible
without any very great expense and
trouble to correct a fireplace that has
been improperly built. If one has in
mind a clear comprehension of the few elementary
principles of fireplace construction
it will usually be an easy matter to
determine the reason why a fireplace
smokes or fails to draw.</p>

<p>The cross-section area of the flue is
likely to prove the most common difficulty.
Usually this cannot be seen from
inside the fireplace, because of the narrow
throat and the smoke chamber which in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>some form may be above the shelf.
If, therefore, the apparent essentials&mdash;such
as shape of opening, narrow
throat across the whole width, and preferably
the slanting back&mdash;have been followed
out it would be well to determine
the area of the flue itself. To do this it
will be necessary to reach the top of the
chimney and, by lowering a weight on a
line, find which flue leads to the fireplace
in question. Its area at the top will in
all probability be its area throughout.
If the flue happens to be the only one in
that particular chimney it may sometimes
be determined more easily by counting the
bricks in its two horizontal directions and
in this way estimating what would probably
be the inside flue. This conclusion
is by no means sure, however, since the
chimney may be built with eight-inch walls
or it may be simply a four-inch wall with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>the flue lining. To one with a knowledge
of bricklaying, however, the way in which
the chimney is laid up will usually indicate
the size of the flue.</p>

<p>Having determined the size of the fireplace
opening and the cross-section area
of the flue itself, it will in many cases be
found that the latter is too small for the
former. The easiest way to remedy this
difficulty naturally would be to decrease
the size of the opening in the face of the
fireplace. In order to check up the diagnosis,
however, it would be well to fit a
pair of thin boards to wedge fairly
tightly into the opening at the top, one
of which boards could be drawn down past
the other one so that the fireplace opening
may be decreased anywhere from six
to twelve inches in height&mdash;using two
six-inch boards. By testing the fireplace
in action in this way it will be readily determined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>by what amount the opening
must be decreased. The boards then being
removed, a wrought-iron curtain or
decorative projecting hood of wrought
iron or copper may be fitted permanently
to the front.</p>

<p>It is possible, however, that the opening
of the fireplace and the flue area are
properly related, in which case it may be
found that the trouble is due to the lack
of a narrow throat and smoke shelf.
This too could be constructed in the fireplace
without disturbing anything outside,
such as the mantel or chimney breast,
unless the fireplace is not large enough
to permit the addition of four inches of
brick at the back. If it is not, it will be
well to examine carefully the thickness of
the wall at the back of the fireplace and
if this is sufficient, part of it could be
taken away where the slope of the back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>joins the upright wall&mdash;about a foot
above the hearth surface&mdash;and the sloping
back built in from there up to form
the throat. Or, to make perfectly sure
of the result, the mantel itself could be removed&mdash;this
is usually merely nailed to
the plaster&mdash;and enough of the chimney
breast taken down to permit the introduction
of a cast-iron throat damper.</p>

<h2><a name="FIREPLACE_ACCESSORIES" id="FIREPLACE_ACCESSORIES"></a>FIREPLACE ACCESSORIES</h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">J</span>ust</span> as a turkey dinner depends
largely for its success upon the
&#8220;fixin&#8217;s,&#8221; so the fireplace is in itself incomplete
without its andirons and tools.
To begin with the most nearly indispensable
appurtenances, we must name the andirons&mdash;or,
if the fuel is to be coal, then
the basket grate. I have wondered sometimes
why the philosophers have not hit
upon the andiron as a particularly fitting
subject for pleasurable rumination.
There are so few things which combine to
such a degree the purely utilitarian with
the eminently decorative qualities. Most
things which do combine the two in any
real measure have been developed on the
side of one at the expense of the other
quality. Take man&#8217;s dress coat, for example,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>the cut-away front of which, with
the two buttons at the back, was designed
to permit the gentleman to loop the skirts
up to his waist when he mounted his horse.
Or, take the modern lighting fixture with
its little pan still waiting to catch the
drip of the tallow beneath the flame, which
has long since been displaced by gas
tip or incandescent filament. How few
things there are, after all, which ages ago&mdash;probably
through a long evolution&mdash;were
designed to meet a real need in the
best possible manner and which still meet
that need and combine true beauty with
their usefulness. The wrought-iron shoe
of a horse occurs to us, perhaps a ship&#8217;s
anchor, a string-bow or an axe helve.</p>

<p>Some support is needed to raise the
fuel so that the air may find a clear passage
under and through it to the flames,
and nothing could well be devised to serve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>the purpose better than the pair of horizontal
wrought bars, each with its single
rear foot and its steadying front, the upper
continuation of which serves to hold
the burning logs in place.</p>

<p>One is not likely to go wrong in making
a choice of andirons for any given type
of fireplace. The simply turned brass
patterns belong so obviously to the Colonial
brick opening with its surrounding
white woodwork; the rougher wrought-iron
types are so evidently at home in the
craftsman fireplace or the rough opening
of stonework, that misfits are hardly possible.</p>

<p>Fortunately the old brass andirons of
Colonial days have proven themselves fitted
to survive, and many of them are still
to be found in old cobwebby attics or in
the more accessible shop of the dealer in
antiques. One of these confided to me his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>way of distinguishing the really old andirons
from artificially aged reproductions:
the old ones have the turned brass of the
front post held in place by a wrought-iron
bar that attaches to the horizontal
member by a screw thread on the bar itself;
on the modern examples this upright
bar is drilled with a threaded hole into
which an ordinary short screw engages
through a hole in the horizontal member.</p>

<span class="caption">The good old dependable Colonial type, with its simple brick facing
framed by the delicately detailed white wood mantel</span>
</div>

<p>Next after the andirons in importance
are the tools&mdash;the three most nearly essential
ones being the poker, tongs and
shovel. There is no need of saying that
these should harmonize with the andirons
and preferably be of brass if they are
of brass; wrought iron if the andirons
are of wrought iron. There are two
ways of taking care of them&mdash;the ordinary
method of using a stand which, if
the tools are bought together, will probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>come with them; or in some of the
fireplace types where the whole chimney
breast is of brick, concrete or stone,
sometimes a combination of three or more
hooks is wrought in the same metal as
the tools and fixed securely in the chimney
breast at the side of the opening.</p>

<p>A brush for the hearth, although not
so frequently seen, is exceedingly useful
in sweeping back the ashes and small embers.
Then there is the time-honored
bellows, now hardly more than an ornament,
for with a scientifically built fireplace
it should never need to be called
into action.</p>

<p>A screen of some sort comes nearer to
being classed with the necessities than
with the merely decorative accessories,
for it is hardly safe to leave a fire or
even the smoldering embers without some
protection against the damage that is so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>quickly caused by sparks. The usual
type of screen is the woven wire one in
several forms. Probably the most convenient
type is that made up of a number
of flat sections which fold upon one
another into a compact mass which will
not be in the way when not in use. In
recent years, however, there is another
sort of screen that is coming to be regarded
with very high favor and that is
the screen made up of glass in combination
with other materials. There is the
simple French screen of glass panes in a
gilded frame, and there are wonderful
possibilities for the employment of the
craftsman&#8217;s skill in combining with plain
or lightly tinted glass more decorative
features in the way of stained glass and
leading or in the combination of glass
and metals.</p>

<p>The design of a fire screen depends, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>course, on the purpose it is intended to
serve. If it is desired to secure a screen
that will cut off the heat but not the light
of the fire, the craftsman will work with
larger areas of clear glass. On the other
hand, it may be felt desirable to make a
nearly opaque screen to cut off both light
and heat. These, of course, are usually
small rectangles on some sort of a pedestal
and are not intended to take the place
of spark screens.</p>

<p>A wood receptacle of some form is a
convenient accessory, as one will avoid
the task of carrying fuel up from the cellar
or in from the woodpile whenever a
fire is desired. There is a broad field
from which to choose&mdash;brass-bound
boxes of many sizes and forms, sturdy
baskets and the metal wood baskets which
are made for holding the logs themselves.
There are those who prefer not to encumber
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>the vicinity of the fireplace with
these rather bulky receptacles, but who
find it convenient to have a box built in
near by in the form of a window-seat or
perhaps as a part of built-in bookcases.
Two or three houses that I have known
had a very simple rough dumbwaiter running
from the cellar up into a window-seat.
This could be loaded with fuel,
hoisted into position and locked there until
the fuel was needed.</p>

<p>There are two other fireplace accessories
that we must not overlook, and these
are the crane and the trivet. The crane
is a very picturesque feature in a fireplace
that is large enough to hold it
comfortably, but it does seem unfortunate
that in a great many fireplaces the
crane is dragged in with the idea of making
it a decorative feature but without
any expectation of putting it to practical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>use. There are fireplaces&mdash;in a
summer camp, for example&mdash;where a
crane could be put to good use. Used
elsewhere it is too often merely an affectation.</p>

<p>The trivet is not nearly so well known
as the crane and yet it might be put to
use in a modern fireplace much more frequently.
In England it is found in various
ingenious forms, most of which show,
however, some form of low stool which is
stood upon the hearth, as near as may be
convenient to the fire, to keep warm a
teakettle or perhaps even a plate of toast.
There are some rather interesting antique
brass trivets to be found in many
of the larger antique shops.</p>

<h2><a name="BUILDING_THE_FIRE" id="BUILDING_THE_FIRE"></a>BUILDING THE FIRE</h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">I</span>have</span> no doubt that the majority
of the readers who have patiently
found their way thus far through this little
book will feel like closing it with a sigh
of impatience at the sight of the chapter
heading above. &#8220;Who doesn&#8217;t know how
to build a wood fire? We might as well
seek instruction as to the most approved
method of striking a match!&#8221; But if
you will bear with me for a moment I
would say most emphatically that as a
matter of fact very few people really do
know how to build a fire. It is easy
enough to assemble a bunch of newspapers,
twigs, kindling and logs so that it
is possible to <i>start</i> a fire, but perhaps
you have noticed that while many fires
are kindled few burn out. If you are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>seeking for the greatest amount of comfort
and enjoyment from your wood fire
you will secure it only by sitting at the
feet of that greatest of all teachers, experience,
or perhaps more quickly by experimenting
a bit with one or two of the
simple expedients which I shall try to
show are based on the wood fire&#8217;s way of
working. While there are those who
would not for worlds give up the pleasure
of tinkering with the tongs and poker
while the fire burns, it will perhaps not
detract from this enjoyment if the tinkering
is not actually the result of necessity
to keep the logs burning. Fire-mending
is a delightful recreation only
when it is not imposed upon us by becoming
an alternative to having the glowing
embers become discouraged and give up
the fight.</p>

<span class="caption">There is a splendid opportunity for home craftsmanship of a high order in
making the copper hood for an example of this type</span>
</div>

<p>First of all, there is the need of having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>fuel that is really dry. It is not essential
that the woodpile be kept indoors,
but it should at least have shelter above
it and on three sides. The woodsheds of
New England farmhouses offer a practical
and efficient solution of the problem.
Usually you will find these as an extension
to the house, a shed open only to the
south, in which the cord wood is piled
neatly to the roof with sawn ends to the
front. Two long logs are laid on the
floor or ground, at right angles to the
firewood, so as to encourage a circulation
of air for drying.</p>

<p>In addition to the heavier logs which
are cut to fit the fireplace opening, there
should be almost an equal quantity of
twigs, brush and smaller pieces, or else
split kindling, to serve as starting fuel.</p>

<p>To lay a fire on the hearth, select first
a heavy log which should be placed close
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>against the back of the fire chamber on
the hearth and not on the andirons. This
is the traditional &#8220;backlog.&#8221; It will
serve through several fires and is intended
mainly as a protection of the back brickwork.
Stand the andirons with their
rear ends close up against the backlog,
and if the latter is of the best size its
top will be well above the horizontal bars
of the andirons. Now select a smaller
log&mdash;preferably not a split piece&mdash;and
lay it across the andirons. If a big
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>fire is desired, keep this log&mdash;the &#8220;forelog&#8221;&mdash;well
to the front, just back of
the andiron upright posts, leaving plenty
of space between backlog and forelog for
the main body of the fire. The distance
between these two logs will govern the
size of the fire. In this space put a few
crumpled sheets of newspaper, some of
the lighter twigs and small branches, and
one, two or three logs or split pieces, as
may be required to fill the space. The
diagrams will make clearer this arrangement
for a small fire or a large one.</p>

<span class="caption">Section showing the arrangement of andirons

</div>

<p>As the central portion of the fire burns
away, keep the forelog pushed back
against it, unless a less active fire is desired.
It is well to remember that where
one isolated log will not burn, two close
together probably will, and a pyramid of
three will do still better.</p>

<p>Many fireplaces show a tendency to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>smoke only when first lighted; this is probably
due to a cold chimney, and can usually
be prevented or made less objectionable
by burning a newspaper just under
the throat, thus starting the proper action
of the up and down drafts.</p>

<p>If it is possible for us to choose between
various kinds of wood for our open
fire fuel there is opened up one of the
most interesting phases of the whole subject.
To most people probably a wood
fire is a wood fire, whether the logs be of
cherry wood, pine, hickory or anything
else. For the wood fire connoisseur, if
we may call him by that name, there is
no difficulty whatever in telling with a
glance at the fire just what wood is
burned. The crackle and explosive nature
of hickory, the hiss of pine, the
steady flame from cherry, the hot and
rapid disintegration of sycamore, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>steady and thorough combustion of soft
apple wood soon become familiar characteristics
to those who have the opportunity
to lay the fire in variety. Then
there is, of course, the fascination and
the weird coloring in a driftwood fire&mdash;most
spectacular of all but unfortunately
denied to most of us.</p>

<p>Finally, the most important factor of
all in the management of a wood fire
is an ample bed of ashes for its foundation.
It is impossible for anyone who
has not actually tried fires both ways to
appreciate the immense advantage that a
bed of wood ashes gives. It unquestionably
doubles the fire&#8217;s efficiency in throwing
heat out into the room, it halves the
care and attention needed to keep the fire
burning, and it increases beyond measure
the beauty of a wood fire, when it is nearing
its end, by rekindling itself with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>embers and keeping alive for a long time
the quiet, dull red glow. Stop your ears
to the importunities of the over-zealous
housekeeper and steel yourself against the
pricks of the conscience of cleanliness.
If need be, fight for the retention of that
bed of ashes. You can scarcely get it too
large or too deep. The accumulation of
two years is a priceless treasure. One of
my own fireplaces has a bank that has to
be depleted about twice a year to make
room for the fire. A peck or two of the
fine white powder is then carried out to
bring joy to the rose garden.</p>

<p>To one who loves a wood fire and knows
its possibilities the mention of such a
thing as an ash-drop is as a red flag to a
bull. Peace be to the ashes of the man
who invented this easy method of robbing
the hearth of half its charm. May he be
forgiven it.</p>
